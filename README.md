# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival EDA

This is a **mini Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** on the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including demographic details (age, sex, class, family size, etc.), ticket fare, and survival outcome. The goal of this project is to explore survival patterns and uncover key insights about which groups of people were more likely to survive the disaster.  

The dataset can be found here: [Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights
- Reading and exploring the dataset  
- Data cleaning and feature understanding  
- Univariate distributions (Age, Fare, Survival counts)  
- Bivariate relationships (Survival vs Sex, Pclass, Embarked, Family size, etc.)  
- Correlation analysis between numerical features  
- Visualizations for better pattern recognition

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- **Women and children** had higher survival rates, supporting the "women and children first" rule.  
- **1st class passengers** had much better chances of survival, showing clear wealth and status advantages.  
- **Fare and class** are strongly correlated, confirming that ticket price reflects social class.  
- Age alone was not a strong predictor of survival, but combined with sex and class it plays a role.
